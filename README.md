# Interactive music game prototype

Game to be used with a custom paddle-style controller that will communicate via web serial.

## Controls

Move character around and enter the red circles (capsules) to then move around and draw audio sequences

Without controller:
- Left / Right arrows rotate player
- Forward arrow:
	- When outside a capsule, tap the forward button to propel forwards
	- When inside a capsule, hold forward to draw the sequence


Contoller implementation later...
